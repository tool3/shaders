# SHAD3RS

OpenGL shaders and threejs experiments.

![](./public/branding/shad3rs-final.mp4)

Some of these experiments are straight from threejs-journey by the great Bruno Simon.  
Other shaders are created by yours truly or collected from tutorials and internet browsing.

# Goal

Threejs-journey is a beautiful comprehensive threejs course that takes you through the ropes and teaches you how to create performant, JS native apps with threejs.

I wanted to create a project that showcased all of these shaders/experiments in a react-three/fiber app so that other could use it or build upon it.

# Want more ?

Open an issue to request a specific threejs-journey shader or experience to be hosted in this project.

# Why

why not ?
