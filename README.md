# SHAD3RS

OpenGL shaders and threejs experiments.

- Scenes and effects from the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) course by the great [Bruno Simon](https://twitter.com/bruno_simon)
- Custom GLSL shaders I wrote or adapted
- Experiments inspired by online tutorials, shader references, and shader browsing (yes it's a [thing](https://shadertoy.com))

# Goal

Threejs-journey is a beautiful comprehensive threejs course that takes you through the ropes and teaches you how to create performant, JS native apps with threejs.

I wanted to create a project that showcased all of these shaders/experiments but in a `react-three/fiber` app with nextjs so that I can share the knowledge and little quirks to make it work and allow others to build upon it.

# Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [GLSL](https://thebookofshaders.com/) for shaders
